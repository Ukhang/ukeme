            Hello I'm Ukhang, I'm a self thought full stack engineer.I have three years of experience working 
            as a full stack developer. I don't have any computer science degree. I could not  take computer 
            science degree due to some family and financial problems. But technology has always been a 
            passion of my life. So I started clearing computer science subjects from internet like C++, 
            Data structure and algorithm, Databases, Discrete Mathematics, computer architecture and 
            much more. Then I learned full stack development by looking at full stack enginner roadmap 
            from codecadamy. I have improved my skills by participating in various hackathons and I have done free classes at various live events on the internet.
